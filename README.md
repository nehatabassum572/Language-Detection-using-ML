# Language-Detection-using-ML
A machine learning project for detecting text language using TF-IDF vectorization and classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest. Features include robust model evaluation with cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV, and a deployment-ready pipeline.


## Features
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Uses TF-IDF vectorization with word-based n-grams (1,3) for feature extraction, configured with max_features=10000, min_df=2, and max_df=0.95.
2. **Model Comparison**: Evaluates four classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) using 5-fold cross-validation.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizes the best-performing model with GridSearchCV for improved accuracy.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides accuracy scores, classification reports, and confusion matrices for detailed performance analysis.
5. **Deployment-Ready**: Includes a saved model pipeline (language_detector_model.pkl) for seamless predictions.
6. **Visualization**: Generates plots for language distribution and model performance comparison.

## Installation 
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nehatabassum572/Language-Detection-using-ML
   ```
2. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the application on jupyter notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook language_detection.ipynb
   ```
## Usage
1. Open the notebook:
  ```bash
   jupyter notebook language_detection.ipynb
  ```
2. Follow the cells to load data, train the model, evaluate performance, and test predictions.
   
3. Use the detect_language function for custom predictions:
    ```bash
      text = "In de wirwar van filosofische bespiegelingen."
      lang, conf = detect_language(text)
      print(f"Text: '{text}'")
      print(f"Detected Language: {lang} (Confidence: {conf:.4f})")
    ```
4.  OR Make predictions with the saved model:
    ```bash
      import joblib
      model = joblib.load('language_detector_model.pkl')
      text = "Le soleil brille aujourd'hui."
      prediction = model.predict([text])[0]
      print(f"Predicted language: {prediction}")
    ```

## Future Improvements
1. Add support for more languages by expanding the training dataset.
2. Develop a web interface for real-time language detection.
3. Enhance visualizations with interactive charts (e.g., Plotly).
